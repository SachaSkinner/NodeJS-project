# NodeJS-project
This "In-Node-Written" project takes 4 functions that complete these tasks:
1)movie-this, 
2)spotify-this-song, 
3)concert-this,
4)do-what-it-says.
With this program you can search for your favorite movie and see information about it, you can search for your favorite song and get a link on Spotify, you can search for your any artist and see information about upcoming concerts, you can also read a file random.txt with a secret command and do it and you can write all your command to a different file log.txt to save your search.
This is a short video showing you how it works.
